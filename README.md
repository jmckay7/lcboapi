# lcboapi

Summary
=======
The web app was written in python. It can be run from the command-line by running:
  ./myserver.py
which will simply output the selections to stdout

In order to run as a webpage, CherryPy was used as a simple web server


Requirements
============
You'll need to install CherryPy in order to run. Details for doing this can be found
here: http://www.cherrypy.org/

Once CherryPy is installed, simply run:
  python ./myapp.py

Then, in a web browser, you can view the page on port 8080:
  http://localhost:8080/


Additional Information
======================
As currently implemented, the application caches the data fetched from the LCBO API
on the first run. Subsequent runs will use the file instead of hitting the web
API for performance reasons. This file can be regenerated by simply deleting it.
